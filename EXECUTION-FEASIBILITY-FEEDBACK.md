# üìã Execution Feasibility Feedback - TESDA Crash Course Day 2 & 3

## üö® Realistic Assessment

**Question**: Do you think all of this can be executed flawlessly?

**Answer**: **Honestly? No, not flawlessly.** Here are the realistic challenges:

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues

### **Day 2 Challenges**
- **CloudWatch Agent**: Configuration errors are common, especially IAM permissions
- **Log forwarding**: Often fails silently if log groups don't exist
- **Lambda deployment**: Requires proper execution roles and VPC configuration
- **Cost concerns**: CloudWatch can get expensive quickly with detailed logging

### **Day 3 Challenges**
- **Systems Manager**: Requires SSM agent running and proper IAM roles
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: CodeCommit authentication often trips up participants
- **Chaos Engineering**: AWS FIS has strict permissions and can be intimidating
- **Auto Scaling**: Complex to configure correctly with proper health checks

---

## üéØ Real-World Execution Issues

### **Time Constraints**
- 90 minutes per project is **optimistic**
- Troubleshooting will eat into time
- Different skill levels will create gaps

### **AWS Account Limitations**
- Service limits (EC2 instances, CloudFormation stacks)
- IAM permission complexity
- Regional service availability

### **Participant Skill Gaps**
- JSON/YAML syntax errors
- AWS CLI authentication issues
- Basic Linux command line struggles

## ‚úÖ Recommendations for Success

### **Pre-Session Preparation**
- [ ] Test all scripts in a clean AWS account
- [ ] Prepare pre-configured AMIs with agents installed
- [ ] Have backup CloudFormation templates ready
- [ ] Create troubleshooting cheat sheets
- [ ] Set up AWS accounts with proper permissions
- [ ] Verify service limits and quotas

### **During Execution**
- [ ] Start with simpler versions, add complexity gradually
- [ ] Have instructor demonstrate first, then participants follow
- [ ] Pair programming for struggling participants
- [ ] Focus on concepts over perfect implementation
- [ ] Build in extra time for troubleshooting
- [ ] Have teaching assistants available

### **Backup Plans**
- [ ] Pre-built environments for quick recovery
- [ ] Demo mode if hands-on fails
- [ ] Simplified versions of complex projects
- [ ] Take-home lab instructions
- [ ] Video recordings of successful executions
- [ ] Alternative exercises if primary ones fail

## üìä Expected Success Rates

### **Realistic Expectations**
- **Project 1 (Basic)**: 80-90% completion rate
- **Project 2 (Intermediate)**: 60-70% completion rate  
- **Project 3 (Advanced)**: 40-60% completion rate
- **Overall satisfaction**: 70-80% if properly managed

### **Success Factors**
- Instructor experience with AWS
- Participant technical background
- Quality of pre-session preparation
- Availability of support staff
- Backup plan execution

## üõ†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation Strategies

### **High-Risk Areas**
1. **IAM Permissions** - Pre-configure roles and policies
2. **Network Configuration** - Use default VPC when possible
3. **Service Authentication** - Provide clear CLI setup guides
4. **Resource Limits** - Monitor and request limit increases
5. **Cost Management** - Set up billing alerts and budgets

### **Contingency Plans**
1. **Technical Issues**: Switch to demo mode with pre-recorded sessions
2. **Time Overruns**: Prioritize foundational concepts over advanced features
3. **Skill Gaps**: Provide pre-work assignments and basic tutorials
4. **AWS Outages**: Have local simulation environments ready
5. **Budget Constraints**: Use AWS free tier and cost-optimized configurations

## üéì Final Recommendation

**Bottom Line**: The content is solid and comprehensive, but expect a **60-70% success rate** on first execution. 

### **Keys to Success**:
- **Thorough preparation** is critical
- **Plan for troubleshooting time** (add 30% buffer)
- **Have fallback options** ready
- **Focus on learning outcomes** over perfect execution
- **Iterate and improve** based on feedback

### **Long-term Strategy**:
- Run pilot sessions with smaller groups
- Collect detailed feedback and pain points
- Refine scripts and documentation
- Build a library of common solutions
- Train additional instructors
