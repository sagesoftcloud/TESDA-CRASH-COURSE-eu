# Module 9 Speaker Script: Architecture Design Workshop
**Duration:** 25 minutes  
**Style:** Collaborative, creative, solution-focused

## üéØ Workshop Introduction & Challenge (3 minutes)
**Script:**
"This is it - the moment everything comes together! For the next 25 minutes, we're going to design TESDA's complete AWS architecture collaboratively.

Here's the challenge: Create a comprehensive cloud architecture that addresses every requirement we've discussed, works within your constraints, and can be implemented in the real world.

[Show challenge slide] You're not just learning about AWS anymore - you're architecting TESDA's digital future. The solution you create today could serve thousands of students and hundreds of staff members for years to come.

I'm going to divide you into teams, give you specific design areas, and then we'll combine your work into one unified architecture. Each team becomes the expert on their area, and together we'll build something amazing.

Ready to design the future? Let's create something extraordinary!"

**Delivery Notes:**
- Build excitement and energy
- Emphasize real-world impact
- Position them as architects, not students
- Use "we" language to show collaboration

## üë• Team Formation & Design Areas (3 minutes)

### Strategic Team Division
**Script:**
"Let's form our architecture teams. I want a mix of technical and functional expertise in each group.

**Team 1: Foundation Architecture** (4-5 people)
Your focus: Multi-account structure, AWS Organizations, billing, and governance. You're designing the foundation everything else builds on.

**Team 2: Identity & Security** (4-5 people)  
Your focus: IAM Identity Center, MFA, cross-account access, and security policies. You're the guardians of TESDA's digital security.

**Team 3: Application Services** (4-5 people)
Your focus: LMS hosting, databases, storage, and application integration. You're designing the systems students and staff use daily.

**Team 4: Compliance & Operations** (4-5 people)
Your focus: Monitoring, logging, backup, disaster recovery, and government compliance. You ensure everything runs smoothly and meets regulations.

[Facilitate team formation] Take 2 minutes to form your teams. Mix departments if possible - we want different perspectives in each group."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Clearly define each team's scope
- Encourage cross-departmental mixing
- Give them time to self-organize
- Move around to help with team formation

### Design Process & Tools
**Script:**
"Each team gets:
- **Architecture templates** with AWS service icons
- **Requirements checklist** specific to your area
- **Constraint guidelines** you must work within
- **Best practices reference** for your domain

**Your 15-minute design process:**
1. **Requirements review** (3 minutes) - Make sure you understand what you're solving
2. **Architecture design** (10 minutes) - Create your solution using the templates
3. **Presentation prep** (2 minutes) - Prepare to explain your design to other teams

**Key rule:** Everything must be implementable in the real world. No theoretical solutions - only practical architectures TESDA can actually deploy."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Show the materials they'll receive
- Give clear time allocations
- Emphasize practical, implementable solutions
- Set expectations for the process

## üèóÔ∏è Collaborative Design Session (15 minutes)

- What permission sets do you need for different roles?
- How do you handle contractors and temporary access?

**Security Controls:**
- What MFA requirements make sense for TESDA?
- How do you implement Zero Trust principles?
- What automated security monitoring do you need?

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- How does a new employee get appropriate access on day one?

"Application team, you're designing the systems that directly serve students and staff. Focus on:

**Core Applications:**
- How will you host the LMS in AWS?
- What database architecture supports thousands of students?
- How do you handle file storage for course materials?

**Integration & Performance:**
- How do applications connect securely?

- What alerts are critical for TESDA operations?

**Backup & Recovery:**
- How do you protect against data loss?
- What's your disaster recovery strategy?
- How do you test that backups actually work?

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- How do you prove to auditors that student data is protected?
- How quickly can you recover from a major system failure?
- How do you handle compliance across multiple AWS accounts?

Remember: Government agencies can't afford downtime or data loss. Plan for the worst-case scenarios."

**Delivery Notes:**

### Facilitator Role During Design
**Script (general facilitation):**
"I'm walking around to each team to provide guidance and answer questions. Don't hesitate to call me over if you need help.

**Common questions I'm hearing:**
- 'Is this service appropriate for government use?' - Yes, if it meets your security requirements.
- 'How much will this cost?' - Focus on the architecture first, we'll optimize costs later.
- 'What if we can't implement everything at once?' - Design the end state, then we'll plan phases.

**Time check:** You have [X] minutes remaining. Focus on your core architecture first, then add details if time permits."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Move constantly between teams
- Answer questions quickly and practically
- Keep teams focused on their core responsibilities
- Provide time updates regularly

## üé§ Architecture Presentations (4 minutes)
