**Style:** Fast-paced, hands-on, security-focused

## üéØ Lab Introduction & Urgency (1 minute)
**Script:**
"Alright everyone, this is our most critical lab! We're going to implement bulletproof authentication that will make your AWS environment virtually unbreachable.

In just 10 minutes, we're going to:
- Create users with mandatory MFA
- Build cross-account access roles
- Implement a policy that forces everyone to use MFA
- Test everything to make sure it works

This isn't theoretical - this is production-ready security you can deploy immediately. Everyone ready to build something that will impress government auditors? Let's go!"

**Delivery Notes:**
- Speak with high energy and urgency
- Emphasize the production-ready nature
- Build excitement about impressing auditors
- Get verbal confirmation of readiness

## üîê Exercise 1: Create IAM User with MFA (3 minutes)

### Quick User Creation
**Script:**
"First, let's create a test user. Everyone follow along:

**Step 1:** Go to IAM Console - search 'IAM' and click the service.

**Step 2:** Click 'Users' in the left menu, then 'Create user.'

**Step 3:** Username: 'tesda-pilot-user' - T-E-S-D-A hyphen pilot hyphen user.

**Step 4:** Check 'Provide user access to AWS Management Console.'

**Step 5:** Select 'I want to create an IAM user' - not Identity Center for this demo.

**Step 6:** Set temporary password: 'TempPass123!' - write this down.

**Step 7:** Check 'User must create new password at next sign-in.'

**Step 8:** Click 'Next' and skip permissions for now. Click 'Create user.'

[Walk around checking progress] Everyone got their user created? Great!"

**Delivery Notes:**
- Spell out usernames clearly
- Give exact text to type
- Walk around helping individuals
- Keep energy high with quick pace

### MFA Setup Process
**Script:**
"Now the critical part - MFA setup:

**Step 1:** Copy the console sign-in URL from the success page.

**Step 2:** Open a private/incognito browser window.

**Step 3:** Log in as 'tesda-pilot-user' with password 'TempPass123!'

**Step 4:** Set a new password when prompted - make it strong!

**Step 5:** Once logged in, go to IAM ‚Üí Users ‚Üí tesda-pilot-user ‚Üí Security credentials tab.

**Step 6:** Click 'Assign MFA device.'

**Step 7:** Choose 'Virtual MFA device.'

**Step 8:** Use Google Authenticator on your phone to scan the QR code.

**Step 9:** Enter two consecutive MFA codes and click 'Assign MFA.'

[Check progress] Who successfully set up MFA? Excellent! You've just implemented government-grade authentication."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Emphasize the private browser window
- Help with MFA app setup
- Celebrate successful MFA setup
- Use "government-grade" for impact

## üîÑ Exercise 2: Cross-Account Role Creation (2 minutes)

### Quick Role Setup
**Script:**
"Now let's create a cross-account role for secure monitoring:

**Step 1:** Go to IAM ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Create role.

**Step 2:** Select 'AWS account' as the trusted entity.

**Step 3:** Enter your own account ID (find it in the top-right corner).

**Step 4:** Check 'Require MFA' - this is critical for security.

**Step 5:** Click 'Next.'

**Step 6:** Search for 'ReadOnlyAccess' and select it.

**Step 7:** Click 'Next.'

**Step 8:** Role name: 'TESDA-CrossAccount-Monitor'

**Step 9:** Description: 'Secure monitoring role with MFA requirement'

**Step 10:** Click 'Create role.'

Perfect! You've created a role that requires MFA for cross-account access. This is exactly what enterprise security teams use."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Keep pace quick but clear
- Help people find their account ID
- Emphasize the MFA requirement
- Connect to enterprise practices

## üõ°Ô∏è Exercise 3: MFA Enforcement Policy (3 minutes)

### The Smart Policy Implementation
**Script:**
"Now for the masterpiece - a policy that forces MFA without locking people out during setup.

**Step 1:** Go to IAM ‚Üí Policies ‚Üí Create policy.

**Step 2:** Click the 'JSON' tab.

**Step 3:** I'm going to show you the policy on screen. Don't type it - I'll provide this in your materials.

[Show policy on screen]

This policy is brilliant. It says: 'You can log in and set up MFA, but you can't do anything else until MFA is configured.'

**Step 4:** Copy this policy from your materials and paste it in.

**Step 5:** Click 'Next: Tags' (skip tags).

**Step 6:** Click 'Next: Review.'

**Step 7:** Policy name: 'TESDA-Force-MFA-Policy'

**Step 8:** Description: 'Enforces MFA for all user actions'

**Step 9:** Click 'Create policy.'"

**Delivery Notes:**
- Don't expect them to type complex JSON
- Explain what the policy does conceptually
- Provide the policy text separately
- Emphasize the brilliance of the approach

### Policy Testing
**Script:**
"Let's test this policy:

**Step 1:** Create a user group: IAM ‚Üí User groups ‚Üí Create group.

**Step 2:** Group name: 'TESDA-MFA-Required'

**Step 3:** Attach the 'TESDA-Force-MFA-Policy' we just created.

**Step 4:** Add your test user to this group.

**Step 5:** Create another test user without MFA and add them to the group.

**Step 6:** Try to access EC2 with the non-MFA user - it should be blocked!

**Step 7:** Try to set up MFA - it should work!

This policy protects your entire AWS environment while still allowing users to secure themselves."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Show the blocking behavior
- Demonstrate that MFA setup still works
- Emphasize the protection aspect
- Build confidence in the solution
