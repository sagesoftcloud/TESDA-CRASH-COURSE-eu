### üéØ Delivery Guidelines

#### Opening (5 minutes)
**Script:**
"Good morning, everyone! I'm [Your Name], a Solutions Architect Engineer, and I'm excited to guide you through AWS Cloud Fundamentals today. 

Before we begin, let me ask - how many of you have worked with AWS before? [Show of hands] Great! And how many are completely new to cloud computing? [Show of hands] Perfect - this session is designed for exactly this mix.

Today, we're going to build something real together. By the end of these 3 hours, you'll have the knowledge to design and implement a secure, multi-account AWS architecture specifically for TESDA's needs. We'll start with the basics and work our way up to advanced concepts, but everything will be practical and immediately applicable."

#### Engagement Techniques
- **Ask questions every 10 minutes** to maintain attention
- **Use real TESDA examples** throughout the presentation
- **Encourage questions** - "Stop me anytime if something isn't clear"

- **Visual demonstrations** - Show, don't just tell

#### Managing Different Skill Levels

#### Body Language
- **Move around** - Don't stay behind podium
- **Use gestures** - Help explain technical concepts
- **Make eye contact** - Connect with different sections
- **Face the audience** - Not the screen

#### Handling Questions
- **Repeat questions** - Ensure everyone hears
- **Acknowledge good questions** - "That's an excellent point"
- **Defer complex questions** - "Let's discuss that during the break"
- **Admit when you don't know** - "I'll find out and get back to you"
