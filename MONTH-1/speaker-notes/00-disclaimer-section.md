# Disclaimer Section for TESDA Presentation
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes  
**Style:** Professional, honest, encouraging interaction

## ðŸŽ¯ Disclaimer & Interaction Guidelines

### **Script:**
"Before we begin, let me set some important expectations about today's session.

**First - This is Interactive Learning**
I want this to be a conversation, not a lecture. Please:
- Ask questions anytime during the presentation
- Share your experiences and challenges
- Interrupt me if something isn't clear
- Participate actively in our discussions

Your questions and insights will make this session more valuable for everyone.

**Second - Accuracy and Honesty**
I need to be completely transparent with you. While I have extensive experience with AWS services and solutions architecture, I cannot guarantee that I'll have the perfect answer to every question you ask today.

**Here's my commitment to you:**
- I will share my real-world experience and best practices
- I will be honest when I don't know something immediately
- I will not give you incorrect information just to provide an answer
- I will help you find the right resources for complex technical details

**Third - Complex Technical Questions**
AWS has hundreds of services and thousands of configuration options. Some questions - especially detailed coding examples or very specific technical configurations - may require research beyond what we can do in this session.

**When this happens, I will:**
- Acknowledge that it's a great question
- Share what I know from experience
- Help you identify the right AWS documentation or resources
- Connect you with appropriate follow-up support

**Fourth - Question Parking**
For questions that need detailed research or are beyond today's scope, I'll use a 'question parking' approach:
- I'll write down your question
- I'll provide initial guidance based on my experience
- I'll follow up with you after the session with complete, verified information

**This ensures you get accurate information rather than my best guess.**

**My Promise**
I'd rather say 'Let me research that and get back to you with the correct answer' than give you information that might lead you down the wrong path.

Your time is valuable, TESDA's mission is important, and you deserve accurate, reliable guidance.

**Questions about this approach?** [Pause for any questions]

Great! Now let's dive into building TESDA's secure cloud foundation."
