# Module 8 Speaker Script: TESDA Requirements Analysis
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Style:** Interactive, analytical, TESDA-focused

## üéØ Module Opening & Collaborative Approach (2 minutes)
**Script:**
"Now we get to the exciting part - designing something specifically for TESDA! Everything we've learned so far has been building toward this moment.

I need your help for this module. You know TESDA better than I do. You understand the challenges, the constraints, the opportunities. I'm going to guide the technical analysis, but I need your insights about TESDA's real-world needs.

[Look around the room] This isn't just a theoretical exercise. By the end of this session, we're going to have a blueprint that TESDA can actually implement. Your input will shape a solution that could serve thousands of students and hundreds of staff members.

Ready to design the future of TESDA's digital infrastructure? Let's start by understanding where you are today."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Emphasize collaboration and their expertise
- Make eye contact across the room
- Build excitement about real-world impact
- Position them as partners, not just students

## üîç Current State Assessment (5 minutes)

### Interactive Discovery Session
**Script:**
"Let's start with an honest assessment of TESDA's current state. I'm going to ask some questions, and I want you to be completely honest. This isn't about judgment - it's about understanding so we can design the right solution.

**Question 1: Identity Management**
Raise your hand if TESDA currently uses:
- Active Directory for user management [count hands]
- Multiple separate login systems [count hands]  
- Shared passwords for system accounts [count hands]
- Manual user account creation processes [count hands]

[Acknowledge responses] Okay, I see a mix of approaches. That's completely normal for organizations in transition."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Encourage honest responses
- Count hands visibly
- Don't judge any responses
- Normalize their current situation

### Security Posture Reality Check
**Script:**
"**Question 2: Current Security Practices**
Show of hands:
- Who has experienced a security incident in the last year? [count]
- Who currently uses multi-factor authentication for critical systems? [count]
- Who has regular security training for staff? [count]
- Who has documented incident response procedures? [count]

[Pause to acknowledge] Thank you for your honesty. This gives me a clear picture of where we're starting from."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Handle security incidents sensitively
- Don't dwell on negative responses
- Thank them for honesty
- Use information to tailor recommendations

### Current System Landscape
**Script:**
"**Question 3: System Integration Challenges**
Let's talk about your current systems. Call out what you're using:
- Learning Management System: What platform? [listen and note]
- Student Information System: What system? [listen and note]
- Financial/Billing System: What do you use? [listen and note]
- Communication Platform: Email, messaging? [listen and note]

[Write responses on board/slide] Now, how many different usernames and passwords does a typical staff member need to remember? [listen to responses]

I'm hearing numbers between 5 and 15 different systems. That's exactly the problem we're going to solve."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Actually write down their responses
- Show you're listening and taking notes
- Let them call out systems naturally
- Summarize the complexity they face

## üéØ Target Architecture Goals (4 minutes)

### Vision Setting Exercise
**Script:**
"Now let's envision the future. I want you to imagine it's one year from today, and we've successfully implemented everything we're designing.

**Maria, a new curriculum developer, starts work at TESDA.**

Day 1, 9 AM: HR adds Maria to Active Directory and assigns her to the Curriculum Development group.

Day 1, 9:30 AM: Maria receives her welcome email with one set of credentials.

Day 1, 10 AM: Maria logs in once and automatically has access to:
- The curriculum development tools she needs
- The appropriate AWS accounts for her role
- Student data systems relevant to her work
- Communication and collaboration platforms

She doesn't need to call IT. She doesn't need multiple passwords. She's productive from hour one.

[Pause] How does that vision sound compared to your current onboarding process?"

**Delivery Notes:**
- Paint a vivid, specific scenario
- Use timeline to show efficiency
- Contrast with their current experience
- Pause for them to imagine the difference

### Measurable Objectives
**Script:**
"Let's set specific, measurable goals for TESDA's cloud architecture:

**Goal 1: Centralized Identity Management**
- Single sign-on for all systems
- Automatic user provisioning based on role
- 90% reduction in password reset requests

**Goal 2: Scalable Multi-Account Structure**
- Separate environments for development, testing, production
- Department-specific resource isolation
- Automatic cost allocation by department

**Goal 3: Enhanced Security Controls**

### Common Challenges & Responses

**Challenge: "We don't have budget for major changes"**
**Response:** "That's exactly why we're designing a phased approach. We can start small and grow incrementally, proving value at each step."

**Challenge: "Our staff aren't technical enough for cloud systems"**
**Response:** "The beauty of what we're designing is that it's actually easier for end users. Single sign-on and automated processes reduce complexity, not increase it."

**Challenge: "We can't risk disrupting current operations"**
**Response:** "Absolutely right. That's why we'll run parallel systems during transition and have comprehensive rollback plans. Student services never stop."

**Challenge: "Government procurement takes forever"**
**Response:** "We'll design the architecture to work with your procurement timeline. Some components can be implemented immediately while others go through formal procurement."
